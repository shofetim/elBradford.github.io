## A Quick and Easy Python Tutorial

_This is a translation from a 90 minute class I held on the basics of Python scripting._

- First released in 1991
- High Level
- OOP*
- Platform Independent
- Great community
- Free and Open Source
- Easy to learn



### Python Applications
- Console / Scripts

### Interactive vs. Script Mode


We will start with interactive mode which gives us immediate feedback

	# python3
	>>> 

Most programmers program Python in script mode. In script mode you can write, edit, load, and save your programs

	# python3 script.py



### Our First Program – “Why do witches burn?”

Open Python in interactive mode and type:

	>>> print(“Why do witches burn?”)
    
What happens?

Print is a _function_, everything within parenthesis are _arguments_

_Functions_ are subroutines that can be reused for common tasks, such as printing to the console



### Our First Program - Again

Let’s write our first program in _script mode_

	print(“Why do witches burn?”)
	input(“Press enter for the answer”)
	print(“Because they’re made of wood.”)

Save the file as `riddle.py`, and from another console, type:

	# python3 riddle.py



## Exercise 1
### ≈5 Minutes

Edit `riddle.py` to display the following every time it is run:

	Riddle Program
	By: [Your Name], accompanied by a(n) [adjective] [your spirit animal]
	[new line]

### Solution

	print(“Riddle Program”)
	print(“By: Bradford, accompanied by a corpulent camel spider”)
	print()



## Comments

Comments are ignored by Python, but are invaluable for programmers.

Indicated by `#`:

	# I’m a comment. 
	# print(“I’m also a comment”)


## Exercise 2
### ≈3 Minutes

Edit `riddle.py` to notate the following:

	The name of your program
	The name of the developer
	The date the script was created
    
### Solution

	# Riddle Program
	# Bradford
	# 15 July 2015
