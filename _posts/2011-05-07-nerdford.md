Last year my mom was scanning photos and found one of me when I was 12 years old. It’s at once horrifying and hilarious.

I’m on the right of my dad and sister. I’m the stud holding a can of Hawaiian Punch.

What’s hilarious? My hooded baseball jersey tucked into my shorts. I am pretty sure I had yellow CAT boots on as well. The hat? My dad’s I think. My head is huge. And the look on my face that says, “I’m the biggest man in St George. Show some respect.” I remember that trip quite well – I remember thinking I was* pretty cool*. Swimming in the pool, chatting up the rich widows in my grandparent’s condo development.

And the horrifying part?  Perhaps I’ve never changed and I’m still blissfully unaware of how much of a Nerdford I am!
