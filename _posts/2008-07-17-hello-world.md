In my eyes, I am not a programmer, though I do work for the BYU Computer Science department programming Silverlight/WPF (C#). A weirdly nerdy programming thing to do whenever you&#8217;re learning a new programming language is to make a &#8220;Hello World&#8221; program that, when executed, prints out &#8220;Hello World&#8221;. So, this is my Hello World. I&#8217;m not a blogger, but I do find it therapeutic to write. In writing I find my soul, the good and the bad, and I discover just how much a stranger I am to myself. In acquainting myself with, well, ME, I also find myself closer to God.

Hello Blog!
