While rebuilding my home server based on ESXi 5.5 hypervisor, I needed to install the operating system. Because I don&#8217;t have an optical drive on the machine, I needed an easy way to run the ESXi installation process from &#8211; and to &#8211; the same USB flash drive. <a href="http://www.tinkertry.com/rufus-takes-2-minutes-to-create-a-bootable-usb-flash-drive-for-esxi-installation/" target="_blank">Tinkertry.com has a great writeup on how to do such a thing</a> using <a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank">Rufus</a>. It was easy and painless, a pleasant surprise when dealing with ESXi!
