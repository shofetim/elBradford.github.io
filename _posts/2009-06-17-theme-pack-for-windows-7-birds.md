I love birds so I decided to make a theme pack with some high resolution wallpapers. I got most of them from <a href="http://interfacelift.com" target="_blank">interfacelift.com</a>, a FANTASTIC wallpaper / photography website. Even if you donâ€™t like birds you will find a wallpaper there that suits your fancy.

    You need Windows 7 or 8 to install this. Most of the photos are 1920&#215;1080 and so appear best on a widescreen monitor.
