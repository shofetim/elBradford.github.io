I am going to conduct a baptism for my church (<a href="http://www.mormon.org" target="_blank">Mormon, or LDS</a>) this Saturday and was tasked with creating a program for the event. I looked around and all the templates I found were lacking in design sense. Comic Sans was a common theme, unfortunately. I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;m no graphic designer, but when I squint really hard I do have half an eye for design.<!--more-->

I chose some classic elements, including an image of Christ being baptized by John the Baptist, by immersion. The front image continues onto the back, where there can be either a scripture or words to a hymn (or whatever you like, really). The inside contains a typical program layout, which can obviously be changed, followed by another image of Christ and a scripture about baptism. This program can be modified to fit any denomination.

I&#8217;ve thrown what I&#8217;ve created up here in hopes that someone else might stumble upon it and find it helpful. Also, the images that I used can be found in my <a title="Life of Jesus Christ: Wallpapers and Themepack" href="http://bradford.la/2009/04/19/theme-pack-life-of-jesus-christ/" target="_blank">Life of Christ themepack / wallpaper pack</a>. I highly recommend downloading it and giving it a whirl. The images are beautiful.

Update 11 April 2015: I&#8217;ve embedded the fonts, so it should look like the image above even if you don&#8217;t have the same fonts installed on your computer.
