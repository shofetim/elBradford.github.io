For Christmas I gave Julie a gourmet dinner, redeemable upon demand. Well, last weekend she redeemed it and it was a lot of fun. I use allrecipes.com for my cooking needs and found all the recipes for this dinner. Links are below along with a self rating on how well I cooked the dish.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2410" src="https://bradford.la/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/f15535240.jpg" alt="f15535240" width="300" height="225" />

Appetizers

  * [Bacon Balsamic Deviled Eggs][1] 5/5
  * [Banana Crumb Muffins][2] 5/5

Main Course

  * [Tomato Bisque][3] 4/5
  * [Chicken Breasts With Balsamic Vinegar And Garlic][4] 3/5

Desert

  * [Chocolate Trifle][5] (using [Home Made Whipped Cream][6]) 4/5

Overall it was a great success. The chicken didn’t turn out great because I used chicken breasts that were too thick. The tomato garlic balsamic sauce was fantastic though.
