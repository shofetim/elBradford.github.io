A week ago I stomped a fat cricket in our unfinished basement and left its carcass as a warning to the others.

A few days later it was gone. That kind of unnerved me; what eats fat dead crickets?

A couple of days later, I spot a giant, belligerent spider. &#8220;Aha!&#8221;, I thought. Here&#8217;s the cricket eater. I stomped him thoroughly and left his stomped remains as another calling card. Now he&#8217;s gone, at least most of him. What else is down here!?!?
