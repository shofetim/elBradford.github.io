I just wanted to announce to all my readers that my blog is back up. Julie, you now know.

It was an arduous process made all the more arduous because I didn&#8217;t know what was wrong with Mr. S (the new name for my Sheeva Plug server that hosts this blog). In the end, I just had to re-flash the linux kernel onto the NAND.

Allâ€™s well that ends well I suppose. I am glad to have Mr. S back though. I didn&#8217;t know how much I needed him until he left me.
