I love my music, and I like to think that my music loves me a little too. I remember as a child finding a cassette tape and recording my favorite song off the radio (piracy started young in my family) to be played back over and over and over again&#8230; I&#8217;ve gone through a whole lotta genres, from Oldies, Country, 80s, Hard Rock, Chill Rock, New Age, Classical, Religious, bla bla bla bla bla.

Now however, I don&#8217;t know if I can pin myself to a particular genre &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;ve reached a state of musical Nirvana (er, wait&#8230;). The following are the playlists that I have syncing to my beloved 30GB first-gen white refurbished zune and reflect the different musical moods I find myself in:<!--more-->

  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bato&#8217; Bugoy</span> &#8211; This is Ilonggo for &#8220;Rock Punk&#8221;, but Bato&#8217; literally means rock (stone?) and Bugoy is kind of a troublesome (usually young) person &#8212; so it makes sense to me but wouldn&#8217;t to a real honest to goodness Ilonggo. This playlist is just a broad swath of Rock and Punk music -> 1661 Songs, 6510 Minutes
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chillax</span> &#8211; This is what I listen to when I am looking for a soothin&#8217; and I don&#8217;t want my music in my face, trying to get my attention. This is working music -> 1590 Songs, 6382 Minutes
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Courage Waves</span> &#8211; This is music that I listen to whilst snowboarding. All Rock/Hard Rock here -> 199 Songs, 757 Minutes
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Groovin&#8217;</span> &#8211; This is the small amount of Electronica or Dance Music (Euro-Pop) I have, like <a href="/ratatat-the-venue-3-september-2008/" target="_blank">Ratatat</a>, Daft Punk, Erasure -> 88 Songs, 349 Minutes
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Savior&#8217;s Love</span> &#8211; This is my uplifting music playlist, full of awesomeness that raises me up when I am down -> 749 Songs, 2818 Minutes

Even with my beloved playlists on my beloved zune, I have been feeling discontent lately. I recently signed up for a <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/products/zunepass/default.htm" target="_blank">Zune Pass</a> and absolutely love it. Trying to find new music through the Zune Pass however has been a chore. It does have some features to recommend music to me, but the music it thinks I want is Top 40 junk that drove me away (crying) from the FM dial to Zunie McZunester in the first place.

So, I have found a new love: Indie. I had a brief 2 month stand with Indie before I was a missionary (post high-school) but on my mission my music choices were limited and I lost what Indie I had (back when Death Cab and Modest Mouse were unsigned).

Doing some internet searches has turned up some pretty sweet resources for discovering music: Podcasts. I used to think that Podcasts were limited to news and uninteresting niche blogs, but hey! They can be used for cool stuff too! I found the following RSS feeds (which, if you plug into iTunes or Zune Software, equals Podcast) for discovering new music, and so far I love what I&#8217;m finding:

  * <a href="http://www.bigcontact.com/hellthy/rss" target="_blank">Hellthy Entertainment &#8211; Audio/Video Podcast</a> &#8211; This feed consists of individual tracks and seems to offer a lot of different styles<a href="http://www.bigcontact.com/hellthy/rss" target="_blank"><br /> </a>
  * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/indiejack" target="_blank">Indie Jack &#8211; Audio Podcast</a> &#8211; This seems to be some guy making hour long playlists of Indie he likes, and from what I&#8217;ve heard, he has good taste
  * <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/dailydose" target="_blank">Insomnia Radio &#8211; Daily Dose</a> &#8211; This is a single-song daily podcast that has my favorite tracks on it so far
  * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/insomniaradio" target="_self">Insomnia Radio &#8211; Standalone Feed</a> &#8211; This feed isn&#8217;t updated as often as the Daily Dose feed, but it contains hour-long playlists
  * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/beatcityradio" target="_blank">Beat City Radio</a> &#8211; This seems to be only hour-long playlists, and isn&#8217;t updated often, but I like what I hear. They&#8217;re based out of Pocatello, ID

The podcasts above represents a lot of opportunities to explore some great music! Another source I&#8217;ve found good for discovering new music of any genre is <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/" target="_blank">Paste Magazine</a>. Each month you get a magazine with a CD of 15-20 tracks. If you keep your eyes out you can get a year sub for $10-20. If you&#8217;re really lucky (like I was) you can get one for $1, but I don&#8217;t know if Paste will ever run that promo again.

If you know of any other sources for good, fresh music, please let me know. I&#8217;m always looking. To close this up, I&#8217;ll post some of my favorite indie (or lesser-known) songs/artists.
