Early this morning I had a terrifying dream.<!--more-->

In my terrifying dream, I was part of a group of inter-dimensional travelers, not unlike those in the television show *<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders_(TV_program)" target="_blank">Sliders</a>* from the 1990s. We slid into a dimension that was exactly like the world found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Legend_(film)" target="_blank"><em>I Am Legend</em></a> – destroyed by a virus that turned humans into fast, evil, light-hating zombies!

As part of our group split off to talk to the non-zombie inhabitants of this world, I was left with the rest of the group to hole up for the night in a rickety wooden house. The house had a light inside, and a light outside, and we had a huge spot light as well to defend ourselves from zombies. The inside light was off because my companions were sleeping.

As my companions slept, I heard a HUGE zombie outside the rickety house, so I decided to turn on the outside light so he couldn&#8217;t come in. The outside light was burnt out! So, I locked the door and grabbed the spotlight to shine on him and burn him. The spot light turned on, and slowly faded to black. It also burnt out!

I couldn&#8217;t turn on the inside light because my companions were asleep and I didn&#8217;t want to wake them. So, I pressed myself up next to the door to hear what the monster zombie was doing. He was on the other side of the door, breathing heavily. I heard him try to doorknob, but it was locked. Then I felt him unscrewing the screws to the doorknob to take the doorknob off. In this moment of absolute terror and helplessness, I heard the soft sounds of Sara McLachlan’s Adia. My alarm was going off.

I haven’t had a nightmare since I was a child!
