Yesterday was my first day officially on the P90X program. The P90X is a 90 day diet and exercise program that I have borrowed from my sister. I&#8217;ve gone through a few of the routines over the last several weeks and I am VERY impressed.<!--more-->

The program requires more than the 60 minutes x 5 days a week I was previously scheduling for the gym. The schedule is vigorous with workouts each morning, 6 or 7 days a week (you have the option to take a rest day, which I most certainly will). I was never impressed with the intensity of other video workouts, but this is completely different. Last week I did the Legs and Back workout &#8211; each is about an hour long &#8211; and for nearly one week now my legs have been going through various levels of hell. I think they&#8217;re coming out though, and to my surprise they say they want to do it again!

To mark my progress on the workouts I have created a calendar on the left side of the blog. Each day I workout according to schedule I will place a red heart. Days I don&#8217;t won&#8217;t have a heart. I don&#8217;t work out on Sundays: gotta have a rest day and why not make it the Lord&#8217;s? <img src="http://bradford.la/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I am EXCITED to work this program! I started it about 2 weeks ago at about 70% intensity and the progress already has been noticeable.

You may notice that today there is no heart. I stayed up late watching movies with my lady friend and I slept in. Not a very good start, I know. BUT, tomorrow is a new day&#8211;a day that will be better than the day before it.

On a slightly related note, I saw Dark Knight at the Imax last night with friends and family. I find it difficult to describe the mood of that movie without using cliche&#8217;s or others&#8217; words. (&#8220;It was so dark!!!&#8221;) I felt sadness more than darkness. The Joker&#8217;s performance was phenomenal and unprecedented, in my opinion. With the feelings of anarchy and chaos that permeate the film, I felt an elusive melancholy. I don&#8217;t offer any spoilers, however I will say this &#8211; Batman&#8217;s victories are never complete. He sacrifices more than the villains, it seems. I very rarely make emotional investments in film, yet I left the movie feeling sympathy for &#8220;the Batman&#8221;. Perhaps that is the melancholy I felt. I will definitely see it again.

After that Ju and I went to her apartment and watched a copy of Cloverfield I had rented from RedBox with a free rental code (several days ago, so much for free!). I quite liked it, maybe because I am partial to apocalyptical movies (&#8220;Soylent Green is made of people!&#8221;). With this and Dark Knight going through my head all night, no wonder I didn&#8217;t wake up early this morning.

Wish me luck on my P90Xperience!!
