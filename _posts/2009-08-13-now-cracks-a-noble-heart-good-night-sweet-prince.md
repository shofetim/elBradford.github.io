You came into my life in January 2004. You left my life on August 13, 2009. You woke me each morning at 6:30 for two years. You were a faithful companion for the following three. You never required a new battery – our love kept you strong enough to beep for me in the dark hours of the morning. I cursed you, but you knew I didn’t mean it for I would always set you before I went to bed again

May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.
