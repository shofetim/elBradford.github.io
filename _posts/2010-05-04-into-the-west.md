This song never fails to remind me of living in Old Escalante in 2004 as a missionary. I listened to it two nights ago, and itâ€™s incredible how real and forceful the emotion that return with the song. I feel like I am back there, in the dark and feeling completely alone. I can hear and smell the rain that was pouring for weeks in Old Escalante and I can still see the darkness that accompanied it night after night as I would fall asleep to this song. There was something to the words and the music that brought comfort to my lonely soul; there still is.
