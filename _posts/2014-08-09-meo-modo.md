The old title of my blog never really sat well with me. I decided today to change the name, temporarily or permanently, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I was just craving a change I suppose.

I am no Latin scholar, but I&#8217;ve always been drawn to the antiquity of the Latin language. The stasis of the dead language, in my mind, keeps it pure. I knew the phrase &#8220;modus operandi&#8221; most likely meant &#8220;mode of operation&#8221;. To confirm I was on the right track, I  asked Google translate what its direct translation was:

If my new blog title means &#8220;I&#8217;m juicy&#8221;, I can live with that.
