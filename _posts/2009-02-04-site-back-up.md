Over the past 4 days my blog has been down. I was silly and decided to swap out motherboards, thinking Vista wouldn&#8217;t have a problem with that. Well&#8230; it did. But, I&#8217;ve been extra diligent by way of daily backups, so almost everything is restored (I lost a few comments, unfortunately).
