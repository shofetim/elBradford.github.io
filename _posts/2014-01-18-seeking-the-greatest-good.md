###### *May the gods give you as much as your heart desires. May they grant you a husband, and also a house, and good like-mindedness, for nothing is better or stronger than when two, like-minded in disposition, keep a house as husband and wife.*

###### * -Odyssey, book 6 180-184*

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">There is a fire and a hunger that burns in each human soul.  This deep hunger we all experience is part of the human condition.  This hunger and its satisfaction, more than anything else, determine the amount of happiness we can experience.  Some have found what will subdue this hunger and they lead lives of peace regardless of their surrounding circumstances.  In all others this fire roars in its discontent, driving them as gypsies from place to place in their search for fulfillment.  In ancient writings we repeatedly see the message that the search ends happily when the object is spiritual.  We hunger to return to our place in God’s presence with our family, and it is in obtaining this that we find true peace and happiness.  Our family imitates the immortal family we came from and in it we find the greatest opportunities for sorrow or joy.  Because of this role in the great common search for happiness, family becomes a victim of the path we take, for good or evil. Ancient texts underscore this lesson that the destruction or exaltation of families hang in the balance.</span>

He knew that possessing wealth, power, or beauty was not the purpose of his life, but that his was to return to and restore his family. It is in that state he knew he would find peace and real, lasting happiness. Indeed, “nothing is better or stronger” than a united family with God (*Odysseus* VI: 180-184).

Beyond simply showing that the greatest good on earth is our family, we see in the *Odyssey* a spiritual homecoming.  Like Odysseus, what will bring us true happiness and satisfy our spiritual needs is a homecoming with our family &#8211; the family of God.  We encounter many counterfeits that may distract us. We will, just as Kalypso warned, meet many sorrows (*Odyssey* V: 206-207) on our journey.  Yet this is the most direct way to real peace that is available to us.  This fulfills our purpose and quenches that hunger we all feel to be close to our Creator.  And we can expect, like Odysseus, to find that our families are blessed when we make this our quest.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1990 alignleft" alt="Oedipus" src="http://bradford.la/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Oedipus-228x300.jpg" width="228" height="300" />

Oedipus had a much different experience than Odysseus in his own search for a happy life in *Oedipus the King* by Sophocles, a tragic example that shows how poor choices can have devastating consequences.  Oedipus was undoubtedly a righteous king, for at his first

appearance he began an aggressive search for a solution to the plague that tormented his people.  His fatal flaw, however, was quickly revealed: too proud to find satisfaction in the spiritual knowledge of the blind priest who offered a solution to the plague, Oedipus stubbornly chose to pursue the investigation which destroyed himself and his family (*Oedipus the King* 432-433).  This behavior was not without precedent, for it was the choice of his own parents that eventually fulfilled the prophecy of the Oracle that Oedipus would kill his father.  Oedipus’ family bore the final awful, bloody fruit of these choices in the resulting suicide and self-mutilation.  Blinded, Oedipus still saw the rubble of his destroyed life and finally knew that real peace comes from God (*Oedipus* 1513-1533).  As Odysseus found sublimity in his path, Oedipus found ultimate despair in his.

We see that miserable outcomes result from innocuous (or even good) choices when those choices do not carry us toward God.  Like Oedipus, Cesar Soubeyran in the films* Jean de Florette* and *Manon des Sources* possessed a proud ambition that could have been a blessing to himself and his family but instead nearly destroyed his family and drove him to the depths of despair.  Having chosen early that he would possess his neighbor’s land at any cost, he was eventually implicated in his neighbor’s death.  How truly miserable he became when, ten years later, he learned that the neighbor he tortured was his own son.

The outcome of our search for good can even be between two good things, as illustrated by Mozart’s *Magic Flute*.  Early in the production, Tamino was given a difficult choice: he may do as the Queen of the Night requested and find true love by rescuing her daughter Pamina, or he may find answers to the questions of his soul by uniting himself with Sarastro, enemy of the Queen.  Seeing the divinity in Sarastro’s wisdom, Tamino knew what would bring him the most joy and made the choice to seek heavenly wisdom.  Through great trials, Tamino proved himself and was admitted into Sarastro’s society with Pamina as his wife.  Tamino understood that the greatest good was not just a family with Pamina, but to have his family with Pamina in God’s presence.  We must, like Tamino, seek the greatest good from God if we are to find it, for God holds the keys to happiness.

Examples of choosing the wrong path to happiness are often tragic because they show the consequent despair of these choices, however there is always the possibility of redemption.  The history of Agamemnon in the *Oresteia* paints a gruesome picture of a family consumed in a generation-spanning vendetta.  Beginning with Tantalus, this family tradition of butchery continues unabated until Orestes, pursued by the Furies for his matricidal crime, appeals to divinity in Delphi.  Murder, infanticide, and even cannibalism tainted Agamemnon’s family name.  Peace seemed impossible, unreachable, yet an appeal to the gods changed the course of this miserable family.  With Apollo as advocate, Athena acquitted Orestes, sending this clear message: a soul trapped in the wrong path may be exonerated by God.  This power of divinity to change the path of a soul is further emphasized when the Furies themselves are changed to become agents of peace (*Oresteia, Eumenides* 1210-1218).<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1991" alt="orestes" src="http://bradford.la/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orestes.jpg" width="700" height="241" />

The fire and hunger that we all experience drives us, fuels our motivations.  They drive us to happiness or, more often, to misery.  These powerful motivations we experience are spiritual in nature and are only satisfied when we satisfy them spiritually.  If we desire to find true, lasting happiness we may find it only on the pathway leading back to our spiritual home.  While on this path, individuals and families are blessed with peace and happiness.  We and our families suffer when we look for satisfaction in the wrong places.  It is only in the family of God we find the peace and security that our souls truly seek.
