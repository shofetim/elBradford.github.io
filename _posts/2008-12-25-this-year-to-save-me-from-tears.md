  The last time we had this much snow on Christmas day I was a little kid! It&#8217;s amazing, especially considering I have a season pass to Sundance with my girlfriend! This is going to be an awesome snow season!

To be perfectly honest I haven&#8217;t been in the Christmas mood this year. <!--more-->I just ended a horrible semester, with 3 classes that I will retake next semester due to lost homework (I turned it in, but I can&#8217;t do anything about them losing it&#8230;), no late homework policies, and missed finals (my test ends early on the last day of finals? Whaaa?!?!?!). At least I have a head start on next semester eh? I mean, I know most of the material so&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll have more time for snowboarding! But even this &#8220;avoid the truth because it&#8217;s painful to look at&#8221; kind of optimism isn&#8217;t doing its normally stellar-job of masking reality this time. To be perfectly blunt, my life is a wreck right now. In all aspects of my life that I deem important, I&#8217;m failing. For example:

  * School &#8211; 3 out of 4 classes I took this last semester will be retaken next semester.
  * Work &#8211; I haven&#8217;t worked as hard as I feel I should have at my job.
  * Money &#8211; I have lots of debt, and my expenses are more than my income.
  * Health &#8211; I&#8217;ve been eating poorly and I haven&#8217;t been exercising regularly.
  * God &#8211; Well, that&#8217;s the worst part, and I believe the cause of all my other problems. I don&#8217;t feel close to him, at least not on an ongoing, regular basis.

Ahhh, a healthy dose of blunt reality is painfully brisk, like alcohol on an open sore. Like I wrote in my last bullet &#8211; my relationship with God affects the rest of my life. My personality is such that I need God constantly in my life or immediately my life becomes unmanageable. That sounds extreme, but my last semester is a prime example. The problem is, sometimes it seems that God is inaccessible, or that to have him close to me I have to fast from everything else in life. I get that hollow, hungry feeling just thinking about giving up the things I&#8217;ve used to *replace *him in my life; my courage fails and I settle back down in my comfortable state, using tricks to distract myself from the real hunger inside me.  
However, I know that my life (and the answer to my problems) is more simple than the tangled knot I&#8217;ve made it. The other day I was watching a short video &#8220;<a href="http://www.mormon.org/freeoffers/1,17785,4545-84-9,00.html" target="_blank">Joy to the World</a>&#8221; that my <a href="http://mormon.org" target="_blank">Church </a>gives out. I realized, and this was a total &#8220;Duh you idiot! Are you blind?!&#8221; moment, but that I really had been carrying all my burdens (see above bullets for an example) *by myself.* I remember reading Pilgrims Progress by John Bunyan when I was much younger. I recall being confused with a lot of the symbolism in the book; in particular the burden that the hero of the story, Christian, carries. If I recall correctly, and it&#8217;s been years since I read this book, he comes to a realization of his sad, burdened state, and he starts to have faith in Jesus Christ. In that moment Christian&#8217;s burden falls off. Just like that, magic. While I was watching &#8220;Joy to the World&#8221;, I realized that ***I*** had such a burden. I realized also that Jesus Christ can lift it off my shoulders.

This year I am going to do it right. I am turned off to the idea of New Years Resolutions, but I love new resolutions. I&#8217;m starting early this year. Tomorrow. Really, I think Christmas is a better time to renew our faith in whatever God we worship, to re-establish our priorities, and to rekindle our love for our fellow man. I know what I need to do to start the process, and I have faith again that instead of feeling hunger when I leave behind bad habits and destructive behavior, I will be facing God and I will feel a fullness of the soul that is absent from any other source. In Ilonggo it&#8217;s called &#8220;ang pagtalikod sa mga sala&#8221; &#8211; the word &#8220;pagtalikod&#8221; meaning a literal turing your back on something, and in this case it&#8217;s a &#8216;turning away from error&#8217;. Having faith in Christ is really the first step, because faith is the fuel to doing many great things, and many small things, like taking another step forward.

Although I didn&#8217;t feel the Christmas Spirit this year, I did feel the Spirit. I am grateful for my Saviour, that he was born on the earth, lived a perfect life, loved each one of us enough to pay for our sins, and died on the cross to complete the Reconciliation of man and God, our Heavenly Father. I hope that everyone can feel that gratitude and the peace that comes from knowing you are loved by God. Merry Christmas.
